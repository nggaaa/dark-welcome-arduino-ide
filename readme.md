# How To Change Welcome Screen To Dark

If you use a dark theme, it will be less if the welcome screen and about are still the default. therefore I made this so that the welcome screen and about become dark.

## Step By Step
I use windows as an example in this tutorial. for other os can adjust it.

- Download all image from [dark](/dark) folder

- Copy or cut all image to Arduino lib folder <br>
Example: ``` C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\lib ``` <br>

- If there is a notification replace file destination then click replace file destination.

- If you have opened the Arduino IDE before copying / cutting the file, refresh the Arduino Idea by reopening the application.
- And see the changes

### If you want to change it to default, I have provided a backup file in the default folder
And do like the steps above.
